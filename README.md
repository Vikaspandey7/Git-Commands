git status - Shows the current status of the repository, including any changes made and files that have not been added or committed.

git log - Displays a list of previous commits made in the repository.

git push - Uploads changes made to the repository to a remote server, such as GitHub.

git pull - Downloads changes made to the remote repository and applies them to your local repository.
